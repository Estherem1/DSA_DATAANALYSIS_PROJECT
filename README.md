### Project Overview: 
This project is a comprehensive Amazon Product Analytics Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel, designed to transform raw e-commerce data into actionable insights. Using a dataset of 1,465 Amazon products—including categories, prices, discounts, ratings, and reviews—we developed a dynamic dashboard that helps users uncover trends in pricing, customer engagement, and product performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;

- What categories offer the highest discounts?
- How are products distributed across price ranges and rating levels?
- How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?

### Final Report
### Summary
1. Ratings Are Generally High
   Most products are rated 4.0 or above, showing a positive customer experience overall.

2. Few Products Dominate Review Volume
  A small group of products received the highest number of reviews, indicating popularity concentration.

3. High Ratings ≠ High Visibility
   Some products with strong ratings had very few reviews, suggesting they’re good but not well-promoted.

4. Categories Differ in Discount Strategy
   Categories like Clothing and Electronics showed the highest average discounts — possibly to stay competitive.

5. Many Products Have <1,000 Reviews
   A large number of products have not yet gained visibility, showing room for growth or promotion.

6. Products Priced ₹200–₹500 Dominate
   Most products fall in the mid-price range, indicating this is a sweet spot for buyers on Amazon.

7. Top Products Have Both High Ratings & Review Counts
   Products that rank at the top in both ratings and review count tend to also have high potential revenue, making them key drivers of marketplace success.

8. High Discounts Often Correlate with Lower Ratings
   Some highly discounted products had average or below-average ratings, possibly due to quality concerns or clearance strategies

   ### Recommendations
1. Promote High-Rated, Low-Visibility Products
   Several products have excellent ratings but very few reviews. These are opportunities for targeted marketing or bundling to increase visibility and sales.

2. Boost Review Engagement for Mid-Rated Products
   Products rated around 3.0–3.5 may benefit from post-purchase emails or incentives to collect more reviews and improve trust.

3. Review Discount Strategy in Low-Rated Categories
   High discounts do not always lead to better ratings. Consider re-evaluating product quality or expectations in categories with both high discounts and low customer        satisfaction.

4. Invest in Best-Selling Categories
   Categories showing high total revenue and high average rating (e.g., Electronics, Health) should be prioritized for inventory, advertising, and promotions.

5. Refine Inventory for Low-Performing Products 
   Products with low ratings and high return potential (based on low reviews despite discounts) should be assessed for discontinuation, repositioning, or repackaging.

6. Use Bundling and Upselling on Top Performers
   Products with high rating scores and review volumes can serve as anchor items for bundles, upsells, or cross-selling strategies.
